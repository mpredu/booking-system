# Movie Booking System v1.0

## Enhanced Version with Bitmasks and Lock-Free Algorithms

This implementation uses **bitmasks for seat representation** and **lock-free algorithms with fairness backoff** for maximum performance in high-concurrency scenarios. The implementation includes exponential backoff (yield + progressive sleep) to provide fairness when multiple threads compete for the same seats, while maintaining lock-free guarantees through atomic Compare-And-Swap operations.When multiple users attempt to book seats simultaneously with any overlapping seats, only one booking will succeed. Any failed booking will be rejected entirely, even if some of the requested seats are available

## 🔧 Building

### Prerequisites

#### Compiler Detection (Automated)
The build scripts automatically detect and use a compatible C++20 compiler:
```bash
./check_compiler.sh  # Standalone compiler check
```

### Quick Start - One Script Does Everything

#### Linux/macOS
```bash
chmod +x do_all.sh
./do_all.sh

2. Configure and build the project
3. Run all tests
4. Generate documentation (if Doxygen available)
5. Build and test Docker image (if Docker available)

### Manual Build

#### Linux/macOS

#### ⚠️ Important Design Constraint: Atomic All-or-Nothing Booking

When multiple users attempt to book seats simultaneously with **any overlapping seats**, only one booking will succeed. The failed booking will be rejected **entirely**, even if some requested seats are available.

#### Example

```
Available seats: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5

User A requests: [a1, a2, a3]  →  ✓ Success
User B requests: [a3, a4, a5]  →  ✗ Failed completely
                      ↑
                  overlap

Result: a4 and a5 remain available (not booked by User B)
```

User B must retry with different seats (e.g., `[a4, a5]`).

#### Why This Design?

This is a **deliberate trade-off** for lock-free implementation:

**✅ Advantages:**
- **Atomicity**: Bookings are always all-or-nothing (no partial states)
- **Consistency**: Users either get all requested seats or clear failure
- **Performance**: O(1) atomic operation, zero locks, maximum scalability
- **Simplicity**: No deadlocks, no complex partial booking logic

**⚠️ Constraint:**
- **Reduced fairness**: Overlapping requests cause total failure, not partial success
- **User experience**: May require retry with different seat selection

#### Use Cases

**✓ Ideal for:**
- High-throughput booking systems (concerts, movies, sports)
- Scenarios where users select small seat groups (2-6 seats)
- Systems prioritizing consistency over maximizing every booking

**⚠️ Consider alternatives if:**
- You need to maximize every possible booking (e.g., always book available seats from request)
- Partial bookings are acceptable to users
- Fairness is more important than performance

### Core Components

**SeatBitmask** - Atomic bitmask operations (4 bytes per combination)
- `tryBook()` - Lock-free booking with CAS + fairness backoff
- `areAvailable()` - Lock-free availability check
- `getAvailableSeats()` - Lock-free seat list retrieval
- `getAvailableCount()` - Lock-free seat counter

**BookingService** - Main service layer
- Movie/Theater management (shared_mutex for metadata)
- Booking operations (lock-free via SeatBitmask)
- Thread-safe with zero contention on seat operations

**Entities**
- `Movie` - Simple structure (id, name)
- `Theater` - Simple structure (id, name)
- `Booking` - Record of successful booking

## 📚 API

### Basic Usage Example

```cpp
#include "BookingService.h"

int main() {
    BookingService service;
    
    // Add movie and theater
    service.addMovie(std::make_shared<Movie>(1, "Inception"));
    service.addTheater(std::make_shared<Theater>(1, "IMAX"));
    service.linkMovieToTheater(1, 1);
    
    // Check available seats (lock-free!)
    auto seats = service.getAvailableSeats(1, 1);
    // Returns: {"a1", "a2", ..., "a20"}
    
    // Book seats (lock-free with fairness!)
    std::vector<std::string> toBook = {"a1", "a2", "a3"};
    auto booking = service.bookSeats(1, 1, toBook);
    
    if (booking) {
        std::cout << "Success! Booking ID: " << booking->bookingId << "\n";
        std::cout << "Seats: ";
        for (const auto& seat : booking->seats) {
            std::cout << seat << " ";
        }
    } else {
        std::cout << "Failed - seats occupied or high contention\n";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Operations

| Operation | Thread-Safe | Lock-Free | Complexity |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| `addMovie()` | ✅ | ❌ (shared_mutex) | O(log n) |
| `addTheater()` | ✅ | ❌ (shared_mutex) | O(log n) |
| `linkMovieToTheater()` | ✅ | ❌ (shared_mutex) | O(log n) |
| `getAvailableSeats()` | ✅ | ✅ (atomic read) | O(20) |
| `bookSeats()` | ✅ | ✅ (CAS + backoff) | O(retries) |
| `getOccupancyPercentage()` | ✅ | ✅ (atomic read) | O(1) |

## 🎯 Detailed Architecture

### 1. **Bitmask Representation (20 bits)**

```cpp
// Instead of vector<Seat>, we use uint32_t as bitmask:
// Bit 0  = seat a1
// Bit 1  = seat a2
// ...
// Bit 19 = seat a20
// 
// 0 = available, 1 = occupied
```

**Example:**
```
Occupied seats: a1, a5, a10
Binary: 00000000000001000010001 (bits 0, 4, 9 set)
Decimal: 529
Hex: 0x211
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Memory**: 4 bytes vs ~264 bytes for vector<string>
- ✅ **Speed**: Bitwise operations (AND, OR) are CPU-native
- ✅ **Atomic**: Single uint32_t = single atomic operation
- ✅ **Cache-friendly**: Fits in single cache line
- ✅ **Scalable**: 100,000 combinations = only 400 KB

### 2. **Lock-Free Booking with Fairness Backoff**

```cpp
bool SeatBitmask::tryBook(uint32_t seatMask) {
    uint32_t expected = occupied_.load(std::memory_order_acquire);
    uint32_t desired;
    
    constexpr uint32_t MAX_RETRIES = 100;
    
    // CAS loop with exponential backoff
    for (uint32_t retries = 0; retries < MAX_RETRIES; ++retries) {
        // Check if seats are available
        if ((expected & seatMask) != 0) {
            return false;  // At least one occupied
        }
        
        desired = expected | seatMask;
        
        // Attempt atomic CAS
        if (occupied_.compare_exchange_weak(
                expected, desired,
                std::memory_order_release,
                std::memory_order_acquire)) {
            return true;  // Success!
        }
        
        // CAS failed → fairness backoff
        std::this_thread::yield();                    // Give CPU to others
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(                  // Progressive delay
            std::chrono::nanoseconds(50 * (retries + 1))
        );
    }
    
    return false;  // Max retries exceeded
}
```

**Fairness Mechanism Progression:**
1. **Attempt 0** - No delay (fast path)
2. **Attempt 1** - `yield()` + 50ns sleep
.....
5. **Attempt 50** - `yield()` + 2.5μs sleep
6. **Attempt 100** - Give up (return false)

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Threads that arrive first have more chances (fewer retries)
- ✅ Threads that retry often wait progressively longer
- ✅ Reduces "thundering herd" problem
- ✅ Balances fairness with performance
- ✅ Prevents livelock (max 100 retries)

### 3. **Compare-And-Swap (CAS)**

```cpp
// Atomic hardware operation:
// if (*ptr == expected) {
//     *ptr = desired;
//     return true;
// } else {
//     expected = *ptr;  // Reload current value
//     return false;
// }
```

**Properties:**
- ✅ **Atomic** - Cannot be interrupted
- ✅ **Lock-free** - No mutex/blocking
- ✅ **Wait-free progress** - At least one thread always succeeds


### 4. **Memory Ordering**

```cpp
std::memory_order_acquire  // Load: See all previous writes
std::memory_order_release  // Store: Make writes visible to others
```

**Guarantees:**
- Thread A: `store(value, release)` → visible to all threads
- Thread B: `load(acquire)` → sees Thread A's store
- No instruction reordering across acquire/release boundaries
- Prevents compiler and CPU from breaking atomicity

## 🎓 Technical Concepts

### Bitwise Operations

```cpp
// Check availability
(occupied & seatMask) == 0  // All bits clear = available

// Book seats
occupied |= seatMask  // Set bits to 1

// Count occupied
__builtin_popcount(occupied)  // Count 1-bits (GCC/Clang)
```

### Fairness vs Performance Trade-off

```
Pure CAS (no backoff):
  Performance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (fastest)
  Fairness: ⭐☆☆☆☆ (random winner)
  Use case: When fairness doesn't matter
  
CAS + yield():
  Performance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
  Fairness: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆
  Use case: Light contention
  
CAS + exponential backoff (current):
  Performance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
  Fairness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (good)
  Use case: High concurrency with fairness needs
  
Mutex (FIFO queue):
  Performance: ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (slowest)
  Fairness: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (100% FIFO)
  Use case: When perfect fairness required
```
